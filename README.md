# Welcome to PokeCardDexJS

This is my first personal proyect with ReactJS, and I made it with educative porpueses while I m still learning how to use (and practice) tools like Webpack, Framer motion, ChartJS, etc.

You can access to the page in the follow link: https://pokecarddexjs.com

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

For download the packages needs to run the proyect


### `npm start`

Launch the proyect with webpack developer mode, to watch changes when you modify the code and testing

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
